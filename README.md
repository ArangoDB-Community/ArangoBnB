# ArangoBnB
This web app is being created to showcase the GeoView functionality of ArangoSearch and to provide an example of ArangoDB being used in a JavaScript stack.

To get started:
* Say hello in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB/discussions)
* [Vote on the framework to use](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB/discussions/3)
* Check out the project todos on the [Project board](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB/projects/1) (pending the framework vote)

Some goals for the project include:
* Search an AirBnB dataset to find rentals nearby a specified location
* Filter these based on keywords, date, and number of guests
* Natural language search (Ex: Houses in Florida with pools.)
* Index data using ArangoSearch Views
* Use AQL for all queries

We would enjoy having anyone from the community participate in the project development!
