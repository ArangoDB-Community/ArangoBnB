# ArangoBnB
This web app is being created to showcase the GeoView functionality of ArangoSearch.

Some goals for the project include:
* Search an AirBnB dataset to find rentals nearby a specified location
* Filter these based on keywords, date, and number of guests
* Natural language search (Ex: Houses in Florida with pools.)
* Index data using ArangoSearch Views
* Use AQL for all queries
