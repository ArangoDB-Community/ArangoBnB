# ArangoBnB
This web app is being created to showcase the GeoJSON functionality of ArangoSearch and to provide an example of ArangoDB being used in a JavaScript stack.

To get started:
* Say hello in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB/discussions)
* Check out the project todos:
  * [Primary Project board (Vue frontend & Backend tasks)](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB/projects/1)
  * [React Project board](https://github.com/users/cw00dw0rd/projects/1)(thanks [@couds](https://github.com/couds) and [@lostpebble](https://github.com/lostpebble) for leading the react version.)


Some goals for the project include:
* Search an AirBnB dataset to find rentals nearby a specified location
* Filter these based on keywords, date, and number of guests
* Natural language search (Ex: Houses in Florida with pools.)
* Index data using ArangoSearch Views
* Use AQL for all queries

We would enjoy having anyone from the community participate in the project development! 
If you have any suggestions or features that you would like to be added start a discussion or open an issue.
